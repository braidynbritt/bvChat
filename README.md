# bvChat
bvChat is a chat application that supports a client-server model. Clients are able to connect to the server, chat with others that are logged in, and leave messages for users that are not logged in. The server will maintain a core set of state that supports varied operations for the users as well as a set of protections for the server.

## Run Server
``` python3 bvChat-server ```

## Run Client
``` python3 bvChat-client <IPADDR> <PORT> ```

## Help Command
This command will show all available commands to the user while running the client.

```/help```
